# mtDNA
Code for the paper  "Big data analysis of human mitochondrial DNA substitution models: a regression approach", BMC genomics (2018) by Keren Levinstein-Hallak, Shay Tzur, and Saharon Rosset.

The file winning_model.R enables to perform a negative-binomial regression on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data to reproduce the winning model for coding genes described in the paper. In order to run the code, please download all other files to a folder and run the file winning_model.R from this folder.

The file data.codon_nbs contains all states extracted from Phylotree's mtDNA data. See the paragraph "Adding exposure to the Poisson and negative binomial regressions" in the paper for the definition of states.
